Flutter Summary:

1. RazorPay Integration: Our project includes a fully integrated secure payment method using the RazorPay API, adhering to the guidelines set by the Government of India.

2. Live Location Tracking: We have implemented a live location tracking system similar to popular ride-sharing services like Uber and Ola. By specifying a source and destination, the system will draw a polyline between them and update the custom car's location accordingly.

3. Important Note: To use the project effectively, it is crucial to create a .env file in the root of your Flutter project and add all the necessary keys and configurations.
